The RapMatcher.py file provides a tag to Rapleaf interest matcher for use with Rapleaf's Personalization API. Make sure to download and install each of "Levenshtein", "PyYAML", and "nltk", Python's natural language toolkit, from easy_install or at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein/, http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML, and http://www.nltk.org/, respectively. An example script which takes an interest as a command line parameter and sends the matched Rapleaf interests to std out is available in Test.py.
